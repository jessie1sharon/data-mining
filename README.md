This project is written in a Jupiter notebook.
Telephone marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to reach out to people for insurance marketing. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Furthermore, the increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced its effect on the general public. 
The goal is to increase the efficiency of direct marketing campaigns for life insurance subscriptions by reducing the number of contacts.

The process:
The classification task is to predict which customers from the test set should be included in the new campaign to minimize its costs
Split the data to train and validation set and use cross-validation method.
Train different classifiers and present evaluation metrics to compare between them
Select the records we need to call in order to minimize the cost of the campaign
